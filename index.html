  Konark Sun temple was constructed in <u>1250 (13th-Century CE) by Narasimhadeva I</u> of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. 
  It depicts The sun god Surya. This temple was called the <u>"Black Pagoda"</u> in European sailor accounts in early 
  1676 because it looked like a great tiered tower which appeared black. Similarly, the <u>Jagannath Temple</u> in Puri 
  was called the "White Pagoda". it remains a major pilgrimage site for Hindus, who gather here every year for 
  the <u>Chandrabhaga Mela</u> around the month of February.

              <dd>- In 1559, Mukunda Gajapati came to throne in Cuttack. He aligned himself as an ally of Akbar and an enemy of the Sultan of Bengal, 
                      Sulaiman Khan Karrani. After a few battles, Odisha finally fell. The fall was also aided by the internal turmoil of the state. 
                      In 1568, the Konark temple was damaged by the army of <u>Kalapahad</u>, a general of the Sultan. Kalapahad is also said to be 
                      responsible for damages to several other temples during the conquest.</dd>

   features the <u>largest single monolithic rock excavation</u> in the world, the <u>Kailash temple</u>, 
   a chariot shaped monument <u>dedicated to Lord Shiva</u>. The Kailash temple excavation also 
   features sculptures depicting the gods, goddesses found in Hinduism as well as relief 
   panels summarizing the two major Hindu Epics.<br>
   There are over <u>100 caves</u>, all excavated from the <u>basalt cliffs</u> 
   in the Charanandri Hills, <u>34</u> of which are open to public.<br>

    <li>These caves were created between the fifth and eighth centuries, with caves 1–5 in the first phase (400–600) and 6–12 in the later phase (650–750).</li>
    <li>Eleven out of the twelve Buddhist caves consist of <u>viharas</u> or monasteries with prayer halls: large, multi-storeyed buildings carved into the mountain face, including living quarters, sleeping quarters, kitchens, and other rooms. </li>

          <u2>History</u2>
        <p>There is an interesting tale about the Kailasa Temple of Ellora. Mughal King Aurangzeb 
        who destroyed thousands of Hindu temple, also tried to destroy Kailasa temple. It is said 
        that 1000 people were sent to destroy the temple in the year 1682. They worked for 3 years 
        but they could break and disfigure a few statues only. Aurangzeb finally gave up on this 
        task and realizing that it was impossible to completely destroy the temple as the rock was 
        simply too hard to demolish, even though artisans used only hammers, chisels and picks to 
        construct it.
        </p>
     
<br>
</div>

<div class="notes-section">
      <u2>Mystery - Kailasa Temple</u2>
<p style="margin-right: 10px">
The actual date of construction is unknown. This temple is carved out of only one rock.
It is impossible to construct the biggest monolithic constructions thousands of 
years ago without any technology. It is carved from top to bottom. Kailasha Temple has 
the world’s largest cantilevered rock ceiling which seems just an impossible feat for a temple constructed thousands of years ago.
It is believed that 400,000 tons of rock had to be removed from the site.

   The Elephanta Caves are on the <u>Elephanta island</u> in Mumbai Harbour 10 kilometres 
   east of Mumbai, in the state of Maharashtra. These Caves consists of <u>five Hindu 
   caves</u>, a few <u>Buddhist stupa mounds</u> that date back to the 2nd century BCE 
   and <u>two Buddhist caves with water tanks</u>. The Elephanta Caves contain rock cut 
   stone sculptures, mostly in high relief, that show syncretism of Hindu and Buddhist 
   ideas and iconography. The caves are cut from solid <u>basalt</u> rock. Except for 
   a few exceptions, much of the artwork is defaced and damaged. The main cave <u>(Cave 1, 
   or the Great Cave)</u> was a Hindu place of worship until the Portuguese arrived, 
   whereupon the island ceased to be an active place of worship. <br>
   The earliest attempts to prevent further damage to the caves were started by British 
   India officials in 1909. The monuments were restored in the 1970s. In 1987, the restored 
   Elephanta Caves were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is currently 
   maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

   The Kanheri Caves are a cave complex consisting of <u>109 caves</u>. It is located 
   in the <u>Sanjay Gandhi National Park</u>, on the former island of Salsette in the western outskirts of Mumbai, India.
   Kanheri comes from the Sanskrit word <u>Krishnagiri</u>, which means black mountain.
   The site is on a hillside, and has rock-cut steps. Most of the caves were Buddhist 
   viharas, meant for living, studying, and meditating. The larger caves, which 
   functioned as chaityas, or halls for congregational worship, are lined with 
   intricately carved Buddhist sculptures, reliefs, pillars and rock-cut stupas.
   <br>
   Kanheri, credited with the largest number of cave excavations on a single hill, is a ticketed monument protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

  On the jamb of the entrance to the veranda is an inscription of Yajna Sri Satakarni (circa 170 CE).

  <u2>Introduction</u2> <br>
    The Mahabodhi Temple also called Great Awakening Temple, is located in Bodh Gaya
    (96 km (60 mi) from Patna) Bihar on the banks of the Niranjana River. The site contains 
    a descendant of the Bodhi Tree under which Buddha gained enlightenment, and has been 
    a major pilgrimage destination for Hindus and Buddhists. <br><br> 
<div class="headings" id="hcvbhsd">Buddha</div>
    Around 589 BCE, Siddhartha Gautama, a young prince who saw the suffering 
    of the world and wanted to end it, reached the forested banks of the Phalgu 
    river, near the city of Gaya. There he sat in meditation under a peepul tree 
    This tree was later named as <u>Bodh tree</u>. According to Buddhist scriptures, 
    after <u>three days and three nights</u>, Siddharta attained enlightenment. 
    In that location, Mahabodhi Temple was built by Emperor Ashoka in around 260 BCE.
    The Buddha then spent the succeeding <u>seven weeks at seven different spots</u> in 
    the vicinity meditating.
</div>    
  <br>

<div class="history-section" style="width:100%">        
    <li>The first week was spent under the Bodhi tree.</li>
    <li>During the second week, the Buddha remained standing and stared, uninterrupted, at the Bodhi tree.</li>
    <li>The Buddha is said to have walked back and forth between the location of the Animeshlocha Stupa and the Bodhi tree. <br>
According to legend, lotus flowers sprung up along this route; it is now called Ratnachakrama or the jewel walk.</li>
    <li>He spent the fourth week near Ratnagar Chaitya.</li>
    <li>In the fifth week, he answered the queries of brahmans. </li>
    <li>He spent the sixth week next to the Lotus pond.</li>
    <li>He spent the seventh week under the Rajyatna tree.</li>
<br>

<div class="headings" id="hcvbhsd">Mahabodhi Tree</div>
The temple was built directly to the east of the Bodhi tree. According to the Jatakas, 
the navel of the earth lies at this spot, and no other place can support the weight 
of the Buddha's attainment. Another Buddhist tradition claims that when the world is 
destroyed at the end of a kalpa, the Bodhimanda is the last spot to disappear, and will 
be the first to appear when the world emerges into existence again.

<li>By the <u>12th century</u>, Khajuraho temple site had 85 temples spread over 20 sq km. </li>
<li>Of these, only about <u>25 temples</u> have survived, spread over six square km.</li>

    <u2>History</u2><br>
The Khajuraho temples where built during the rule of Chandela dynasty. They started the building
process immediately after their control over Bundelkhand region. <br>
   <li>Most temples were built during the reigns of the Hindu kings Yashovarman and Dhanga.</li>
   <li>Yashovarman's legacy is best exhibited by the <u>Lakshmana Temple</u>.</li>
   <li>Dhanga's legacy is best exhibited by the <u>Vishvanatha temple</u>.</li>
   <li>The largest and currently most famous surviving temple is Kandariya Mahadeva built in the reign of King Vidyadhara.</li>
   <li>The first documentation of Khajuraho was made in 641 by Xuanzang, a Chinese pilgrim.</li>
   <li>In 1022 CE, Khajuraho was mentioned by <u>Abu Rihan-al-Biruni</u>, the Persian historian who accompanied Mahmud of Ghazni in his raid of Kalinjar.</li>
   <li>In 1495 AD, Sikandar Lodi's campaign of temple destruction included Khajuraho.</li>
   <li>In 1852, <u>F.C. Maisey</u> prepared earliest drawings of the Khajuraho temples.</li>
The name Khajuraho, or Kharjuravāhaka, is derived from ancient Sanskrit (kharjura, means 
date palm, and vāhaka, वाहक means "one who carries" or bearer). Local legends state that 
the temples had two golden date-palm trees as their gate.
