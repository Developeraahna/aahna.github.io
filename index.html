  <p> <u2>Introduction</u2> <br>
  Konark Sun temple was constructed in <u>1250 (13th-Century CE) by Narasimhadeva I</u> of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. 
  It depicts The sun god Surya. This temple was called the <u>"Black Pagoda"</u> in European sailor accounts in early 
  1676 because it looked like a great tiered tower which appeared black. Similarly, the <u>Jagannath Temple</u> in Puri 
  was called the "White Pagoda". it remains a major pilgrimage site for Hindus, who gather here every year for 
  the <u>Chandrabhaga Mela</u> around the month of February.

              <dd>- In 1559, Mukunda Gajapati came to throne in Cuttack. He aligned himself as an ally of Akbar and an enemy of the Sultan of Bengal, 
                      Sulaiman Khan Karrani. After a few battles, Odisha finally fell. The fall was also aided by the internal turmoil of the state. 
                      In 1568, the Konark temple was damaged by the army of <u>Kalapahad</u>, a general of the Sultan. Kalapahad is also said to be 
                      responsible for damages to several other temples during the conquest.</dd>

          <u2>Notes</u2>

    <li>Konark is a combination of two Sanskrit words <u>Kona</u> (corner or angle) and <u>Arka</u> (the sun).</li>
    <li>It is located on the <u>Bay of Bengal coastline</u> in the Indian state of Odisha. </li>
    <li>In Hindu Vedic iconography Surya is represented as rising in the east and traveling rapidly across the sky in a chariot drawn by <u>seven horses</u>. </li>
    <li>The name of the seven horses are <u>Gayatri, Brihati, Ushnih, Jagati, Trishtubha, Anushtubha, and Pankti.</u>
    <li>Surya has two females who represent the dawn goddesses, <u>Usha and Pratyusha.</u> </li>
    <li>The architecture is also symbolic, with the <u>chariot's twelve pairs of wheels</u> corresponding to the 
           <u>12 months of the Hindu calendar</u>, each month paired into <u>two cycles (Shukla and Krishna)</u>.</li>
    <li>The main temple at Konark, locally called <u>the deul</u>, no longer exists. It was surrounded by subsidiary shrines. <u>The deul was built on a high terrace.</u></li>
    <li>The temple was originally a complex consisting of the <u>main sanctuary, called the rekha deul, or bada deul (big sanctum)</u>. In front of it was <u>the bhadra deul (small sanctum)</u>, or <u>jagamohana (assembly hall of the people (mandapa) )</u> The attached platform was called the <u>pida deul</u>. 
    <li>On 16 February 1980, Konark layed directly on the path of a total solar eclipse.</li>
